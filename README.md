> Hi, I am Israel Laguan, a professional full stack developer willing to collaborate as a team player building better code. 

Welcome to my portfolio, I want to show you my skills and why I consider myself a professional programmer!

## About Portfolio Website

The website is done without any framework: HTML, CSS, VanillaJS. I've made the whole process from designing to make animations. A lot of researching is involved but I am happy about the result.

I've added the code to GitHub, sans sensitive configuration files, so that prospective employers, clients and colleagues can have a snoop around my code.

The website is meant to be short, flashy and atractive, but maybe you want to more about me or take a look to my code. Please visit [My Projects][] repository and [My Codes Biblion Project][]!

## Featured Projects (and some extras)



## More about me

I studied maths before starting to work for a game company called Vertex Studio. Then I moved to Colombia and worked as a freelancer developing several production-ready backend and frontend projects. Lately, I entered Microverse, where I fine-tuned my software technical skills along with my professionalism as a remote programmer. Would you mind if I set up a quick call next week for us to talk about any upcoming opportunities on your team? Please [email me][] or reach to my socials networks
